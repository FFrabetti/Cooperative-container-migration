# Container Migration Set-up on ORBIT #

The ORBIT open access testbed for next-generation wireless networking at Rutgers University, developed under the National Science Foundationâ€™s NRT (Network Research Testbeds) program addresses the challenge of supporting realistic and reproducible wireless networking experiments at scale.  

The ORBIT large-scale radio grid emulator consists of an array of ~20x20 open-access programmable nodes each with multiple 802.11a,b,g or other (Bluetooth, Zigbee, GNU) radio cards. The radio nodes are connected to an array of backend servers over a switched Ethernet network, with separate physical interfaces for data, management and control.  Interference sources and spectrum monitoring equipment are also integrated into the radio grid.  Users of the grid emulator system log into an experiment management server which executes experiments involving network topologies and protocol software specified using an ns2 like scripting language. A radio mapping algorithm which uses controllable noise sources spaced across the grid to emulate the effect of physical distance is used to map real-world wireless network scenarios to specific nodes in the grid.

For the container migration evaluation at scale, we use ORBIT testbed for our experimentation.
