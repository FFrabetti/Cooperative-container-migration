# Container Migration Set-up on ORBIT #

The ORBIT open access testbed for next-generation wireless networking at Rutgers University, developed under the National Science Foundationâ€™s NRT (Network Research Testbeds) program addresses the challenge of supporting realistic and reproducible wireless networking experiments at scale.  

The ORBIT large-scale radio grid emulator consists of an array of ~20x20 open-access programmable nodes each with multiple 802.11a,b,g or other (Bluetooth, Zigbee, GNU) radio cards. The radio nodes are connected to an array of backend servers over a switched Ethernet network, with separate physical interfaces for data, management and control.  Interference sources and spectrum monitoring equipment are also integrated into the radio grid.  Users of the grid emulator system log into an experiment management server which executes experiments involving network topologies and protocol software specified using an ns2 like scripting language. A radio mapping algorithm which uses controllable noise sources spaced across the grid to emulate the effect of physical distance is used to map real-world wireless network scenarios to specific nodes in the grid.

For the container migration evaluation at scale, we use ORBIT testbed for our experimentation.

#### Steps ####
- Reserve ORBIT resources
- Set-up resources
- Carry out migration experiment
- Collect results
- Release resource

#### Use-cases ####
- Stateless migration 
- Stateful migration

For both these cases, we evaluate following schemes.
- Centralized Traditional Container Migration (CTCM)
- Centralized Layered Container Migration (CLCM)
- Distributed Layered Container Migration (DLCM)

## Procedure ##
1. Reserve resources on the ORBIT. We use SB4 for the tests and Grid for final evaluation. 
2. Load the image to bring up Docker, CRIU and other dependencies:
```
omf load -i containerlm1.ndz -t all
omf tell -a on -t all
```

The image containerlm1.ndz is created as follows:

a. Load baseline image for Ubuntu 16.04 on the ORBIT testbed (used SB4 here and using node1-1 as a playground to create the final image):
```
omf load -i baseline-ubuntu-16-04-64bit.ndz -t node1-1
```
b. SSH to the node1-1 from SB4 console:
```
ssh root@node1-1
```
c. Install CRIU version 2.6 on the node1-1:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install criu
```
d. Install Docker version 19.03.5 on the node1-1:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```
e. Run the prepare script at the node1-1 to make it ready for imaging:
```
$ bash prepare.sh
```
f. From the console of SB4, run the following command to save the image:
```
$ omf save -n node1-1.sb4.orbit-lab.org
```
g. The image is saved. Note down the name of the image. 

3. Login to the node1-1 and node1-2 to run the set-up script:
```
ssh root@node1-1
bash setup.sh
```
The setup script will create executables in the /root/bin directory. 

4. Follow the steps listed on the [this page](../docs/trafficgen.md) to test different applications.
