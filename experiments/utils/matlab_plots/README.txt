latency_cdf_src_dst_stateful - CDF plot of latency when SRC load > DST load for the stateful application. Chosen cases are 25, 28, 31, 34 where the volume size is 100 MB.
latency_cdf_src_dst_stateless - CDF plot of latency when SRC load > DST load for the stateless application. Chosen cases are 25, 28, 31, 34 where the volume size is 100 MB.
system_latency - average latency for all the cases for different layer size (all 36 cases are used)
traffic_per_link:: total traffic as discussed
traffic_stateful: Incoming to (dst) and outgoing from src, node1 and node2 traffic averaged per channel
